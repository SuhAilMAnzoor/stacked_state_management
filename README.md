Stacked State Management Discussed with Code

## Getting Started
# 🚀 Flutter App with Stacked State Management (MVVM)

This project demonstrates how to build a **Flutter app** using the **Stacked architecture** based on the **MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel)** design pattern.  
It ensures a **clean, testable, and scalable** codebase by separating the UI (View) from the business logic (ViewModel).

## 📌 Features
- 🏗️ **MVVM Architecture (Model–View–ViewModel)**
- 🔄 **Reactive State Management** with `stacked`
- 📱 Modern **Flutter UI**
- 📡 Example API integration (can be extended)
- 🔑 Easy **Navigation** & **Dialog management**
- 🧪 **Testable ViewModels** (business logic separate from UI)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Flutter** (UI framework)  
- **Stacked** (state management + architecture)  
- **Dart** (language)
